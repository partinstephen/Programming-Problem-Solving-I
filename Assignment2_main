Write a program that prompts a user to input his/her name (save it as a variable
of type String) and his/her age as a whole number of years (save it into a variable 
of type int). Convert the age from years into seconds while ignoring passed leap
years. Display the result of conversion (age in seconds) along with the user name in a single print statement.
